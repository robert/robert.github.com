I spend a lot of time talking to and writing for people who are learning programming. I describe my audience as "advanced beginners", a phrase that strikes loud chords with many people. My definition of an advanced beginner has evolved over the last few years, but here’s my current version:

> An advanced beginner is someone who feels like they pretty much get it, but at the same time feels like they have no idea what they’re doing.

I believe that I’ve identified two main sub-types of advanced beginner: Alice and Bob. In this post I’ll describe who they are and how I’m trying to help them. If you don’t identify with either Alice or Bob then I’d love to know[LINK]. If your name begins with a "C" then I’ll even name the new persona after you.

### Alice

Alice works in a frustrating job she doesn’t like. She’s heard that computer programming is a fun and well-paid alternative profession. Some of her friends-of-friends have taught themselves to code in their spare time and have landed exciting new careers. She’s decided that she’s going to learn too. In some alternate, parallel universes Alice recently completed a computer science degree, but she feels like it failed wretchedly to prepare her for the real world.

Alice is medium-to-high-serious about learning. In the last 4 months she’s worked through both Learn Python the Hard Way and Python Crash Course. She’s enjoyed them both, and now really feels like she understands variables, if-statements, for-loops, functions, and so on.

Alice tries to work on bigger projects. But she almost always gets stuck. She doesn’t have any friends who are programmers, and so she doesn’t have anyone to help unstick her. She never knows whether her code isn’t working because the problem she’s trying to solve is too difficult, or because she missed out a comma. Even when her code works, she never knows whether she’s doing it "right". People on the internet tell her not to worry about this, but she does, very much.

She buys another book called "Python for Beginners" but it's just the same stuff that she already knows. She buys "Python for Intermediates" but it’s all too difficult. She starts watching YouTube videos but they are mostly dross. She wants to get better but she hasn’t even been able to work on what "get better" means in this world. Maybe she needs to learn more programming languages? Alice reads "The Poignant Guide to Ruby" and enjoys it, but now she just knows two flavors of the same basics. She still doesn’t really understand classes and objects.

She does some Googling. "How do I get better at programming?" she asks. She finds lots of optimistic but perfectly useless advice. "Work on projects that solve your own problems!" OK, but my main problem is that I’m not as good at programming as I would like to be. "Read other people’s code!" OK, I went to github.com, now what? "Work on Open Source!" That sounds good, but where do I apply?

Most Alices stay on the sad side of the hump forever.

### Bob

Bob already has a job as a computer programmer at a small company, where he's the solo developer on their website. He likes his job but he feels like a fraud. He can slap together lines of code that solve the immediate problems in front of him, but he has a nagging certainty that if anyone else looked at his code then they would shout at him and call him a moron and a charlatan. He doesn’t know exactly why though. He wants to keep learning, but no one who he works with has the skills or interests to help him.

He tries pursuing some side-projects. They usually work, more or less, but he’s running out of ideas and he thinks they’ve stopped teaching him very much. His codebases quickly turn to spaghetti, no matter how many Tweets he reads saying "Good programmers always make sure to separate their code’s concerns!" He has no idea how to stop this from happening.

I did not expect Bobs to see themselves as advanced beginners. I expected them to see the term as patronising and beneath them - "uh I know how to test my code thank you very much, have you seen the job title on my business card?" But for many people even getting paid to write code does little to fend off the worry that their code is terrible and their employer is a fool.

## How I’, trying to help Alice and Bob

I write two series to help advanced beginners through the Valley of Despair and up the steep but scalable Cliff Face of Challenging and Well-Paid Employment:

* Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners
* Programming Feedback for Advanced Beginners

Here’s how they work.

### Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners (PPAB)

The goal of PPAB is to help people remember that programming can be fun. Each installment is a semi-guided project that breaks the end goal up into bite-size milestones without telling the reader how to eat them. The reader gets enough hints to save them from becoming irrevocably stuck, but has all the difficult work left up to them. The end result of each project is a complex program that does something snazzy, like produce ASCII art or photomosaics or play unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI[LINKS]. Readers get a well-constructed base program that they can take in all manner of wacky directions that I could never have come up with.

PPAB doesn’t directly show readers how to write "good" code, but it does teach them how to break down and think through problems. It also motivates them to write *more* code, which is surely a necessary precursor to that code becoming "good". Readers who want to write better code may be interested in my other series, Programming Feedback for Advanced Beginners (PFAB).

### Programming Feedback for Advanced Beginners (PFAB)

The goal of PFAB is to help readers think about their code from new angles, such as efficiency, reusability, and maintainability. PFAB gives readers the experience of analyzing abstract problems with an experienced, kind, good-looking co-worker. Readers send me code that they’ve written, and I suggest ways they can improve it. We cover topics like exception handling, program structure, and input validation, and we deal with the murky tradeoffs inherent in programming in the real-world. The most popular post in this series (which admittedly falls a little outside the normal structure) is an 8,000 word magnum opus called Systems Design for Advanced Beginners[LINK], in which we look at the way in which large tech companies lay out their databases, APIs, and other infrastructure. The moral of this particular PFAB is that there’s a lot going on but none of it is magic.

I'm writing a book about being a dad. It's for new parents, old parents, the curious, and the undecided. It's about all of parenthood's big and tiny questions, including:

* Will my kids make new friends? Actually who cares - will I make new friends?
* What's superhuman AI going to mean for our kids? What's it going to mean for me?
* What should we do this weekend? And next weekend? And the one after that?
* Should my kids learn the piano? When should they start? What if they don't want to? What if they're extremely, extremely good at it?
* Does anything I try and do for my children make the slightest bit of difference? Or are they already just whoever they are and thereâ€™s nothing for me to do for them but squeeze them and watch?

The book is based on [my parenting blog posts](https://robertheaton.com/#parenthood) and I'm going to publish it in Q4 2025. Current working title: *You can do anything and so can I*. If you've enjoyed anything else I've written then I think you're going to love it. You should therefore:

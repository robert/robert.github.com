The problem with smartphones is two-part:

1. Phones destroy our ability to be present, be bored, think deeply, and to concentrate. I could cite some studies in partial support of this claim, but the most compelling evidence in its favour is that that it's obviously true.
2. Phones make life unimaginably better

The amazing thing about phones is that they do everything. The terrible thing about phones is that they do everything. If you want instant access to the good parts of YouTube, you also have to carry around the bad parts of YouTube. You have to constantly remember not to watch them - including the short-form videos. If you want to stay in regular contact with your friends and family, you also have to give a hundred people the ability to make your pocket vibrate, at any moment. Did someone text you just now? No; it was just the wind. Hopefully soon though! 

Imagine if you didn't have a phone. You'd go outside more and read books more. You'd sleep more and feel better. You'd think different.

But you'd also talk to your friends less. You'd never take an Uber or a Lime Bike, and you'd get lost all the time. You'd look up new facts less, you'd never listen to podcasts, you'd have fewer photos of your family and friends, and you'd have to go all the way to your laptop in order to access your online banking. And this is just a partial list of the many, many uncontroversially good things about your phone. We haven't even had to debate whether scrolling Twitter keeps you up to date with the news in your niche, and whether that's worth it.

Phones are terrible, and phones are amazing. So we make tradeoffs. When I'm drifting off to sleep, I want to be able to listen to a podcast about Magic: The Gathering. I don't want to read the morning headlines or my overnight text messages within seven seconds of waking up. But you can't have one without the other.

And when I go for a walk I want to send myself an email whenever I think up one of my trademark Deep Thoughts. I don't want to flit over to The Guardian or my group chats afterwards. But you can't have one without the other.

And when I'm working I want to know if something truly important happens to someone in my life. I don't want to be on-edge with the knowledge that my phone might vibrate at any moment, for any reason, and knock me out of whatever I was doing. But you can't have one without the other.

(My pocket just vibrated; I promise I'm not making this up. I'm in a library, writing a thousand words about how concentration is everything and smartphones are the mind-killer, and there's still no way I'm not going to look at my phone right now)

(It was a dad-friend reacting "ðŸ˜‚" to a joke that someone else had sent our chat. Now I've completely lost my train of thought. But we're becoming quite good friends, and that would never have happened without WhatsApp)

Many of the downsides of phones are the same as the upsides, just in a different context and taken to the extreme. This duality makes their successful, lasting mitigation difficult.

But mitigate we must. Look at the stats in your screentime app that tell you how much time you spend on your phone every day. Multiply that by three-hundred-and-sixty-five. Multiply that again by however many decades you think you have left. Convert to full, entire years of your life. The downside of your phone really is terrible.

But you can do something about it.

### Why normal mitigations fail

Normal mitigations fail because they're either ineffective, or too effective.

For example: phones have screentime controls. You can use them to block websites; limit the time you're allowed to spend on apps per day; and restrict the time windows during which you can access them. Setting boundaries like this is a good idea and better than nothing. But you can always disable the blockers, and you can always convince yourself that this is the right thing to do. Once I've turned new screentime controls off enough times I become so practiced at doing it that I stop noticing them. Eventually I stop re-enabling them. 

You can uninstall all of the apps that don't make you happy, and disable notifications for almost all the rest. This is another good idea. But no matter how spartan your app habits, you will always have a web browser, and you will always have messaging apps. You will always have access to the entire internet and to everyone you know. They will always be right there, just inside your pocket.

So you can go further: you can throw your smartphone into a storm drain and replace it with a device like [a Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/). Light Phones have an e-ink screen, a custom operating system, and almost no apps. They look fantastic - revolutionary even. And completely impractical.

I've never used a Light Phone. But I'm confident that for most of us, it's simply too much (or too little). You can't join WhatsApp or Signal groups. You can't use mobile banking or Uber. You can't use multi-factor authentication. And you can't ever - never - look anything up.

One of the quotes on the Light Phone homepage reads: "It's more than just a simple phone, it's a lifestyle change." This lifestyle change is the awesome benefit of a Light Phone, and also the unacceptable cost. If you ask your dad then he'll be very happy to tell you how much better life was when a phone was a phone. He'll be half right when he says that, but the other half of him will be dead wrong. 

So how can you mitigate the downsides of your phone?

Hide and burn, baby.

### Two mitigations that work

#### 1. Hide your phone

Put your phone in a different room for as much of the day as you can. Get it when you need it, then put it back. Check it for messages as infrequently as you can manage.

Do you always need to be contactable? Do you really? Would you feel anxious if you went swimming for an hour? Or had a massage? Or a deep nap? If not then put your phone in another room and check it once every sixty minutes.

This is easy for me to say. I work from home, and I'm not on the hook for much. My kids almost never break their arms. Even if they do, I'm not a doctor and there's nothing I can do to help. I'll be there soon enough. Having children in school can't possibly mean that parents have to be next to their phone all day; that wouldn't be a good way to run a society. I put my phone in the other room and imagine that I'm swimming, all day long, in one hour bursts. Even checking your phone once an hour is probably too often. What would it be like if you didn't look at your phone for an entire day? How would any of us ever know?

If you really don't think that you're able to hide your phone like this then do whatever it takes to make it so that you can. Get a smartwatch that vibrates when - and only when - you get called. Make your phone ring on loud. Accept that you'll miss a few time-sensitive messages and that this is worth it.

Once you manage to ditch your phone, you can increase the frequency and duration of your phone-free periods by buying yourself another phone.

#### 2. Buy a burner

The terrible thing about smartphones is that they can do everything. So get a burner phone that can't. My own burner phone has only three apps: an email client with a throwaway account for sending myself notes; PocketCasts for podcasts; and Audible for audio books. It has no apps that feel like "being on your phone". This means no web browser; no messaging; no notifications; almost no way in or out.

My burner allows me to make notes and listen to audio, without having to decide if I also want to check my messages or whatever's new on the internet. It cleaves in twain the tradeoffs of using a single phone, and allows me to leave my main handset in the other room for much more of the day.

I use my burner when:

- I go for a walk for up to an hour
- I'm reading a book downstairs and might want to make some notes
- I'm tidying the kitchen or going to sleep and I want to listen to a podcast

Here's how you can make your own burner.

#### How to build a burner

Buy a secondhand Android phone (I have a Pixel 7, Â£150 from BackMarket. It has no SIM card, just wi-fi). The phone has to be an Android because then you can remove the web browser using [Android Debugger](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) (ADB), and a burner isn't a burner if it has a web browser. By contrast, iPhones don't let you delete Safari. You can hide it, but it will still be there, lightly hidden in your App Library. I guarantee that you will find it.

To set your device up:

1. Plug the phone into your computer
2. Flash [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) onto it for a clean start and a little extra control (this is optional - stock Google Android is OK too)
3. Install `adb` on your computer. Ask your favourite search engine or LLM how to connect it to your phone (you can make a partial burner phone without `adb`, but using `adb` is the only way to remove the web browser, and I think that this is extremely important)
4. Run the script below to hide all of the default system apps and dial down all the noise and jitters that the phone makes.

```
# Disable system apps that your burner phone doesn't need
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.messaging
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.contacts
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.dialer

# This might need to be com.android.browser or com.android.chrome for
# some versions of Android.
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 app.vanadium.browser

# Make the display black and white
adb shell settings put secure accessibility_display_daltonizer_enabled 1
adb shell settings put secure accessibility_display_daltonizer 0

# Activate dark mode
adb shell cmd uimode night yes

# Turn off touch and UI sounds
adb shell settings put system sound_effects_enabled 0
adb shell settings put system touch_sounds_enabled 0

# Turn off haptic feedback
adb shell settings put system haptic_feedback_enabled 0

# Turn off keyboard and dialer sounds
adb shell settings put system dtmf_tone_enabled 0

# Turn off lock screen sounds
adb shell settings put system lockscreen_sounds_enabled 0
```

You now have a completely blank canvas, to which you can add back a tiny number of carefully chosen apps.

*My phone.*

#### Which apps?

You get to choose. But I'd suggest a few principles:

* Only apps that don't feel like "being on your phone"
* As few apps as possible
* No notifications, ever
* No feeds
* Very few ways to send you information of any sort

Apps that I think are OK:

- Spotify
- Kindle
- Maps
- Podcasts
- Anki
- Audible
- Email client with a burner account that you only use for sending messages to yourself

Apps that are probably unnecessary:

- Online banking
- Online shopping

Apps that completely defeat the point:

* Web browser
* Any messaging
* Any social media
* Any RSS or Bookmarking
* Any email

I'm not sure about AI apps like Claude and ChatGPT - it probably depends on how you use them. I'd start without them and then add them in if you really need them.

Consider adding an app to your burner phone if:

- You find yourself regularly using it on your main phone
- \- when you're trying not to use your main phone
- \- and you're happy that you're using the app

## In conclusion

It can feel impossible to get away from your phone. We all use them for a huge fraction of the day, and they're on our minds for all of the rest of it. As useful and fun as they can be, I don't think this is good for us. It's certainly not good for me.

I've been hiding-and-burning my phone for several months. I still fiddle with my phone too much when it's around, but now it's around much less.

Hide-and-burn hasn't solved all of my problems. I still need to carry my phone when I go out for long periods of time. I'm still a computer programmer, which means that I still spend all day staring at my laptop. This means that I still have constant, instant access to the entire internet, as well as thousands of Slack channels with fantastic content that all make me feel like I'm being productive. But that's a different challenge. My laptop lives upstairs and it doesn't have a SIM card, and anyway it's much too big to fit in my pocket.

Hide-and-burn is a small step that makes a big difference. Give it a go.

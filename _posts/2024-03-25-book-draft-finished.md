For the last eighteen months I've been writing a book about being a dad. Two weeks ago I finished the first draft!

The book is inspired by [my blog posts about parenting](/#parenthood), but most of it is brand new and I think it might be very good. It's about childbirth, covid, careers, old friends, new friends, kid friends, chess, pianos, screens, AI, marriage, and much more.

Now that I've finished a draft I'm looking for an agent and a publisher. I've never done this before so I'd appreciate help and advice! Please get in touch if:

* You've published a book or know someone who has
* You are a literary agent or you know someone who is
* You'd be up for giving feedback on a first draft
* You have some words of encouragement
* You have any thoughts or ideas of any sort about anything

If you want to find out when the book is ready, [subscribe to my newsletter](/newsletter). If you have friends who you think would enjoy the book, tell them about it and [make them subscribe too](/newsletter).

Thanks!

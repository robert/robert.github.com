I was onto a scandal, but not the one I thought.

A few months ago I [exposed the way in which Wacom graphics tablets track every application that you open on your computer][wacom]. I asked my readers to send me tipoffs about other potential privacy abuses. Last week I received an email suggesting that I take a look at the Terms and Conditions of [House Party][houseparty], a "video social network" that has recently surged in popularity because the outside world contains nothing but disease and despair. I perused [the company's policies][houseparty-ts-cs] and found a lot of queasy-making data collection, but none of it was any worse than what one should expect from a consumer application that doesn't charge you anything.

However, one paragraph did catch my eye:

> **Information Submitted Via Services.** You agree that Life on Air [the company behind House Party] is free to use the content of any communications ubmitted [sic] by you via the Services, including any ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services. 

Wowee, thought I. Does this mean that House Party gets to scan your conversations and steal your ideas? I fired off an innocent email to House Party asking for clarification. Unsurprisingly I never received a reply, but I decided that I didn't need one since the language was already self-explanatory. I settled down to write a sharp-keyed exposé.

I may be a thoroughly amateur journalist, but I'm also a principled one whenever it's convenient and doesn't dull the hatchet too much. I decided that I should do some cursory research into how many other companies claim the same rights to your intellectual property as House Party. "Everyone else is doing it" is not an excuse, but it is a mitigating factor.

I Googled for the phrase "free to use the content of any communications submitted by you via the Services". Maybe House Party had borrowed their language from a competitor. Maybe I'd discover the fate of the missing s in "ubmitted". I expected one or two search results at most. 

There were over 300.

That's 30 Google pages of companies asserting the right to use any and all content that flows through their services, for any purpose, regardless of where it came from or who it was intended for. These companies range from [CrossVerify][crossverify], a provider of anti-money laundering data, to [Lunalife][lunalife], a moon-based motivation app. And these are just the organizations who assert these rights using the same Terms and Conditions template that they copy-pasted from the same discount lawyer. It seems reasonable to assume that there are hundreds more declaring the same privileges using slightly different words.

I'm not sure if this is better or worse than House Party being the sole perpetrator of this nonsense. On the face of it, hundreds of companies claiming a license to any idea that strays within two hundred yards of their headquarters is much worse than one company doing so. However, dusting off my rarely-used benevolent hat, the fact that so many of them are doing it implies that the language is legal boilerplate, and that no individual company has any immediate intention of actually invoking the clause. None of these companies' primary business plan is "steal people's ideas", although they do all reserve the right to pivot if [being a digital assistant for elder care][aloecare] doesn't work out.

Keeping my benevolent hat on despite gale force winds, I assume that the clause is included as a defensive measure. Perhaps companies want to make absolutely certain that they are in the legal clear if someone sends them some helpful advice that they decide to take. Perhaps they want to pre-empt lawsuits in which a user claims that the company read their communications and stole their ideas, since the company can point to the line in their Ts+Cs that gives them the right to do this, not that they ever would.

Even so, the wording is still surprisingly aggressive. I wonder why a company would include it in their Ts+Cs, and I wonder whether it would stand up in any kind of contested legal battle. Even if there's an innocent-sounding explanation, one should always be cautious about giving any profit-seeking enterprise the benefit of the doubt when the other side of that doubt could be profitable.

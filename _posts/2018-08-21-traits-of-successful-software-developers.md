I initially wanted to call this talk something much more cautious. Maybe "A few things I've seen people do that I think are smart although I don't have any randomized controlled trials to prove it". I was eventually talked up to "[Traits of Successful Software Developers](https://www.bigmarker.com/microverse/Traits-of-Successful-Software-Developers-w-Robert-Heaton-from-Stripe)". Whilst I still don't have any randomized controlled trials, I do still think that the 23 chracteristics and habits that I discuss are extremely powerful.

I work at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) on the Frontier Red Team. We’re hiring AI researchers and engineers in the US and the UK. It’s the best and weirdest job I’ve ever had and I really hope you’ll apply.

Our mission is to find out whether AI models possess critical, advanced capabilities, so that the world can prepare accordingly. Can models design bioweapons, or accelerate vaccine research? Can they orchestrate massive cyberattacks, or defend our critical infrastructure? Can they self-improve, or build a business, or fly drones? We conduct deep research into these questions in order to produce the evidence for companies, governments, and the world that will make super-intelligent AI go well. Here’s [a Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-safety-testing-red-team-anthropic-1b31b21b) article that talks a bit more about how we do this.

We’re a technical research team embedded inside both Anthropic’s policy and research organizations. We work with frontier models; top experts in every domain that we work on; and key national security and policy actors. We aren't a normal tech company team. We're growing, and we need more exceptional people to help us.

Here are the people we need:

## RSP Evaluations

Our RSP Evaluations sub-team designs and runs the evaluations for Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/news/announcing-our-updated-responsible-scaling-policy) (RSP). The team:

* Works with internal domain leads and external domain experts to design and build cutting edge evaluations across cybersecurity, biosecurity, AI R and D, and more
* Builds sandbox environments to safely run these evaluations
* Builds automated analysis frameworks to make sense of all the results
* Builds agentic frameworks to squeeze the best possible performance from models

I think this is a great job for anyone, and the best job in the world for generalist engineers who are also interested in AI. You get to spend half your time building bulletproof systems for novel technical problems, and the other half thinking earnestly about how many tokens it might take for an AI model to build a GPU cluster to copy itself onto. If you work in computer infrastructure anywhere else then I’m convinced that you would have more fun working here instead.

## Domain teams

We believe that the most important capabilities that models are likely to develop are in autonomy, biosecurity, and cybersecurity. We have small sub-teams that lead research into each of these domains. These teams:

* Carry out threat modeling. What would it even mean for a model to be dangerous in this domain? How could it cause catastrophic harm? What capabilities would it need?
* Design evaluations that test for these capabilities
* Run large-scale experiments on these evaluations; understand what capabilities current models have and don’t have; predict when these capabilities might emerge
* Build safe demonstrations of dangerous capabilities to show to experts and stakeholders

The people on these teams get to work on projects from reinforcement learning to understanding the biggest threats and opportunities facing society. Never a dull moment.

* Biosecurity - [Research Engineer, San Francisco][bio-re]; [Research Scientist, San Francisco][bio-rs]
* Cyber - [Research Scientist, San Francisco / Seattle][cyber-rs]

## Logistics

The team is full of brilliant people who care a lot about their jobs and each other. Most of the team is on the West Coast of the US, with some on the East Coast and a couple in London. I work from London and my schedule is great, even with two kids. I go into the London office once a week and to SF a couple of times a year.

## Apply now

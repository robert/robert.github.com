My five year-old just got into football. Really, really, won't-sit-down, won't-let-anyone-else-sit-down, into football. For the last few months my wife and I have spent every free minute taking half-hearted shots on goal, feigning agony as a vigorous counterattack puts us 23-0 down, and guessing which hospital Harry Kane was born in.

To try to buy us a minute to breathe and shower, I invented a game called ["Dice Football"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rLwTG3LiXmAVnodnl0yjB4a6idm_zt21jFutJeNiX14/edit). In Dice Football you roll two 6-sided dice, add up the numbers, then consult a table to see what happens next. When the game is over you enter the results in [your tournament tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15mSKIDJ-Kh45pbUrwZ06DyPW7EcdG0dglga6R1CKTTM/edit?gid=0#gid=0), then start the next game. Hopefully this all takes you at least an hour. Dice Football is a 1-player game, which means that no one has to win or lose, and mummy and daddy get to do something else for a bit.

Dice Football was a surprise, obsessive, breakout hit. As long as we kept our son fed with pens and exercise books, we could have all the showers we wanted. Dice Football was also a gateway into the dice-based simulation game genre. Over the following weeks I could barely keep up with my son's appetite for new games. His favourite was ["Dice US Federal Election,"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k-lIiQhSuXffkIQcMNFxZdhkG7C3CZBnJ9fw70pjEkY/edit?gid=0#gid=0) where you roll dice to figure out which party wins each state, then borrow daddy's phone to add up the electoral college votes.

I soon ran out of ways to generate sums with 6-sided dice, so I bought some 20-siders. These big boys kept things interesting for another week or two. But then I started to chafe against the limits of simple dice. I started to get ambitious. I wanted to make games that used sums with arbitrarily customisable structure and difficulty. For example, instead of the simple `A+B = ?? (where A<=6 AND B<=6)` form of two 6-sided dice, I wanted sums like:

* `A*B + C*D = ??` (for example: `4*2 + 14*3 = ??`)
* And the addition portion crosses a 10 boundary
* And `A*B < 20` and `C*D < 50`
* And all variables are between 2 and 100

If the answer to this sum is even it's a goal for Chelsea; if it's odd then it's a goal for Liverpool. Or whatever.

It wouldn't be feasible to build these sums using dice, and I certainly wasn't going to construct them by hand. Instead, I needed a way to generate an infinite stream of highly-specific questions.

So I wrote one: `SumChef`.

## `SumChef`

`SumChef` is a Python library that generates massively-customisable infinite maths quizzes.

For example, to generate a stream of questions using the example constraints listed above, you would write:

```python
from sumchef import *

# Declare the variables
a, b, c, d, e = variables(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
vs = [a, b, c, d, e]

# Declare the form of the equation
lhs = Add(Multiply(a, b), Multiply(c, d))
rhs = e

# Declare the constraints
constraints = [
	AdditionCrosses10Boundary(Multiply(a, b), Multiply(c, d)),
	IsLessThan(Multiply(a, b), Literal(20)),
	IsLessThan(Multiply(c, d), Literal(50)),
	Equal(lhs, rhs),
]
# Declare the domains over which to search for valid sums
domains = uniform_domains(vs, range(2, 100))

# Find variable bindings that form a valid equation
bindings = find_bindings(vs, domains, constraints, n_bindings=10)

# Print each set of bindings as an equation with a random value held out
for bnd in bindings:
	lhs_expr = expression_string(lhs, bnd, hold_out=e)
	rhs_expr = expression_string(rhs, bnd, hold_out=e)
	print(f"{lhs_expr} = {rhs_expr}")
```

This prints:

```
9 * 2 + 11 * 2 = __
4 * 2 + 10 * 4 = __
2 * 5 + 16 * 3 = __
6 * 2 + 5 * 6 = __
# ...and so on...
```

## Advanced usage

You don't have to print the questions as a static worksheet! You have programmatic access to the questions' contents and you can do anything you want with them. You can put them on a website, or a game, or an app. Your code knows what the correct answer to each question is, so it can check whether the player's answer is correct. You can even automatically adjust the difficulty of the generated questions based on how the player does.

For example, I made a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app that I deployed to Streamlit cloud. Now I can write a new game with new rules, program in their sum format into the app, hand my son an iPad, and have the iPad generate the equations of the form and difficulty needed to power the game.

Infinite fun.

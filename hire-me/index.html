I am looking for my next thing.
</p>
<p>
I've spent the last few years working on some fantastic products with some even more fantastic people, and I am keen to keep on doing this. I built most of <a href="http://bluefields.com" target="_blank">Bluefields.com</a>'s (500 S12, Downtown Project) alpha platform, and the company closed a $1M seed round on the basis of this product. I then went to war on corporate email at <a href="http://copyin.com" target="_blank">Copyin.com</a>, where we built some beautiful software that obliterated our own problems but sadly not enough of other people's. I wouldn't change anything though.

</p>
<p>
Now I want to join a fast-growing product company, most likely in the San Francisco Bay Area (I have an H1B visa). Broad sectors I particularly like include education, medicine, devtech and academia, but that might only be because I know nothing about cathedral construction or running a banana stand.

</p>
<p>

By trade I am mostly a Rails engineer, with all the good jazz that comes with this - JS, Coffee, Ember, Backbone, Postgres, git, Heroku and many other keywords. I'm not religious though; I've fiddled with PHP, Python and Prolog and had a great time with 2 of them.

</p>
<p>

I thought that I just invented a pretty solid pun (Py-curious), but a quick Google suggests that I am not as original as I had hoped.

</p>
<p>

I have a BA in Physics from Oxford University and an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College.

I've written quite a few things that I think on <a href="http://robertheaton.com" target="_blank">my blog</a>. I've had >100,000 visitors in the last 8 months, and have been <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/319196730367299586" target="_blank">tweeted by DHH</a>. Which is somewhat tenuous social proof, but it's still DHH damn it. I'm also proud of:

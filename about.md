I'm a researcher at [Anthropic][anthropic] on the frontier red team.

I've written a book about being a dad that I'm working on [getting published](/book-draft-finished).

On this blog I write about:

* [Uncovering online privacy violations][wacom]
* [Online tracking][online-tracking]
* [Being sneaky][weseeyou]
* [Network security][tcp-reset]
* [Economics][economics]
* [Teaching programming][ppab]
* [Reading][how-to-read]
* [Magic: The Gathering][mtg]
* [Being a parent][childbirth]
* [Writing stories][in-context]
* [Writing clearly][style-guide]
* [Synthwave music production][gary-computer]
* [Video games][skyrim]

I also like chess, but I haven't written any blog posts about that. I used to [live in San Francisco][sf]. Now I live in London.
